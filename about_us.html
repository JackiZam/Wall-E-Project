                    <div class="bio">
                        <p>Diego Rubio is pursuing an Industrial Engineering Major along with a Minor in Computer Science at the Burnett Honors College at UCF. He finds passion in all things engineering, from robotics and 3D printing to computer science. During high school, he was co-captain of the Vex Robotics team 241E. This team won numerous regional awards, qualified for world championships all three years Diego was involved, and ended up winning an excellence award at World Championships 2021, the highest award given out.</p>
                        <p>So far in college, Diego has joined SEDS, a space-focused engineering club which designs and builds rockets and other space related engineering projects. He currently works for a nonprofit tutoring company serving underprivileged kids in the community. In his free time, Diego enjoys spending time with friends, catching up on the latest news, as well as playing Kerbal Space Program or Civilization VI.</p>
                        <p>While discussing their mutual love of robotics, Shanny brought up the idea of building a Wall E to Diego. From then on, they worked together to find other passionate team members who could make the project come to life. Through the project he hopes to learn about project management, engineering design, and the numerous systems required for Wall E to function.</p>

                        <p>Shanny Ruiz is currently a Computer Engineering student in the UCF Burnett Honors College. She graduated from Timber Creek High School as Summa Cum Laude with various industry certifications in 3D-modeling and other creative softwares. During her time in highschool she was awarded with the NCWIT Aspirations Regional Affiliate title three-years in a row to highlight her aptitude as a woman in STEM.</p>
                        <p>Now at UCF, Shanny is an active member of the Robotics Club and is pursuing an interest in electrical system design and programming languages (Java, C, Javascript, etc). Some other endeavors she enjoys practicing are her proficiency in Japanese and volunteering for the local community.</p>
                        <p>It has been Shanny&#39;s life-long dream to pursue a future in robotics so she pitched the idea to create a life-size Wall-E to the current team lead Diego, and together they gathered a team of proficient STEM students in order to fulfill the vision. She looks forward to improving and sharing what she learns during the process in a detailed-manner.</p>
